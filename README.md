####Personal C++ Implementation of some machine learning algorithm
I have some implementations in Matlab. Just want learning algorithm to be more efficient and scalable. 
Python is another choice because Scipy is a very good package for science computing. 

#####Based on Boost

_Clustering:_     
KMeans     
DBSCAN     
GMM
